# Nick Belichenko's Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I've built this portfolio website using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. It was really fun to design the interface using Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion made the site look really cool with all the animations.
